This project demonstrates the use of Multiple Linear Regression to predict individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

The model takes into account the following variables:

Age (numeric)

Gender (categorical → one-hot encoded)

BMI (numeric)

Smoking status (categorical → one-hot encoded)

By combining numerical features with encoded categorical features, the model was trained using scikit-learn’s Linear Regression. 
This project highlights how regression models can be applied in healthcare cost analysis and how preprocessing techniques like 
one-hot encoding enable the inclusion of categorical data in machine learning pipelines.
